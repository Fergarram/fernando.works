I've been dweling about whether or not I should prioritize the work on implementing artificial minds.

I had a conversation with [Nick Reese](https://nicholasreese.com/) where we talked about what one should do in his mid-late 20s. In summary, he explained to me that ideally one should be living with as little resources/expenses as possible and to focus on making riskier "asymetric bets" which basically means that the possible output is greater the initial input. Or at least that's how I understood it.

Near the end of the conversation, I briefly told him I wanted to work on artificial minds or operating systems (I'm actually not sure which I said) but he seemed to understand exactly what I was talking about because he immediately pointed me towards [Alexander's work, on the future of OSes](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/). I told him I had a collection of notes that I've written in the past few years but that they were not public (except from one [cringy sample](https://cass.netlify.com) and a site that I will never share hahaha). Nick told me to publicly start documenting this instead.

After the call was over I headed to Alexander's work and to my suprise it was mind-blowingly similar to my notes and concept of a future OS which artificial minds would use. His work was so well documented that it inspired me to retake my almost forgotten dream of working on these ideas.

Since you're reading this, it means that I have decided to make this public and document ideas, thoughts, prototypes, etc. I hope you find this work as enjoyable as I do.

## Artificial minds are not AI

I want to make it very clear that this is not about AI algorithms, deep learning, etc. What I mean by "artificial mind" is essentially a software-emulated mind that, as any organic animal mind, forms world models based on the senses in its body and survival needs.

A mind has to have a goal. The goal is to understand the world through the information received by the senses in the body in order to survive or maintain its own existance (ego). The body of an animal is what mostly defines how exactly the animal is to interact with the world. For example, if it uses legs to walk, eyes to see, etc. The specifics of the body depend on the world and environment where the body will be situated.

An artificial animal, would live in an artificial world. Artificial means we are responsible for defining and creating how that world works and what the animal needs and does.

Let's try to make this more tangible. Think about an RPG or better yet an MMORPG like [Tibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia_(video_game)). An artificial mind would represent the player. The body would have the same senses you have when you play the game: keyboard controls where you either press a button or release it and a single viewport of the game's graphics. In terms of raw data though, you get binary states for buttons and pixels for graphics. There's way more into this but I'll keep it simple for now.

There's a goal in the game, to not die and to level up. The goal could actually vary since that's something that the player decides, but keep in mind that the player is not the character. When you play this game, in order to achieve those goals, your mind starts learning about how the game works - how your character moves, how it attacks, how it gets XP points, pick-up items, etc. Your mind starts learning all there is to how to move through this new world as this character / body. That's what your mind evolved for and that's what an artificial mind is designed for.

## Why does this matter?

The former is just a single way one could go about creating a world and its rules and we could get into more detailed analogies with MMORPGS but it would make this a very long introduction. The main purpose I see for creating artificial minds today is for delegating digital-intensive tasks. I think that artificial minds are a key part of the future of how we'll interact with computers and the ever-growing complexity of software needs.

Better customizable OSes and better UI are not the only benefit or purpose. Robotics and virtually every field where there are activities that depend on our human ability to express ideas about how something works could benefit from being able to create artificial minds.

The best way to visualize the impact a technology like this could have is by asking ourselves what could we do if there was a tireless person living in our computers willing to work for us?


## What's the goal or vision?

The main long-term goal is for people to be able to raise their own minds to do the things they want them to do. My job here would be to provide them with tools to successfully train and raise artificial minds.

Next up, I talk in more detail about where and how we could use artificial minds and how I think we can build them.
