Back in December of 2015, my cousin [Mario](https://flogar.itch.io/) and I created a game for the [GM48 Jam](https://gm48.net/). As this supposes, we built this game using Game Maker 8. Mario implemented the initial idea and all the visual and audio assets for the game. Once that was in place I polished and implemented the “complex” mechanics of the game like the level generation.

Since this game is so simple, I've used it in different attempts to learn different enginges or tools for game development. The only successful one has been the [KaiOS edition one](/projects/amateur-archaeology-kaios-edition/).
