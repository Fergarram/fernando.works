Joponlu.tk is the domain name we used to own (it's now a Netlify subdomain). It was another collaboration between my cousin [Mario](https://flogar.itch.io/) and I. We wanted a space where he could post his art stuff like music, shit, and games. Back then I would not call myself a frontend developer. I made this site using Contentful for the backend and jQuery for the frontend. The site is not optimized at all, it's insecure and it is pretty slow.

I've worked on a re-make of this using Svelte but haven't done any significative progress as to publish it. I'm probably gonna get back to it one day.
