_"It's the time of the evola crysis, people are pooping every where. Even you."_<br>â€” Game Description by Fernando 2014

This game was originally done for the #indiesvspewdiepie game jam back in November 2014. I believe this was my first ever game jam I participated. The idea and implementation were done by me.
