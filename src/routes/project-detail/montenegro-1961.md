Montenegro is a small game that follows the story of a boy who likes a girl in a boy/girl scout camp. This game was made in under 48 hours and was made using Game Maker 8.1 (my favorite version of GM). It was very fun to make with my cousin [Mario](https://flogar.itch.io/), he came up with the base idea and we developed it together.
